# Nobel App

### The Nobel app uses two open endpoints about the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Laureates from Nobelprize.org website. 

### The goal was to use React to retrieve and display the data with a personal UI and Design using styling frameworks such as Radium or Module.css

The home page allows the user to select the category of its choice :

On the category page, the user can display all the laureates using one endpoint with the button "SHOW ALL LAUREATES BY YEAR":

and can search by Year or by Name using another endpoint with the "SEARCH" button :

The first endpoint displays all the laureates for each year on the same card. 
The second endpoint displays each laureate on a single card.
